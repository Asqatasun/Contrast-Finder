## Designing for Colour Blindness
- [Designing for Colour Blindness](https://sidigital.co/articles/designing-for-colour-blindness/) (Si digital / 2016)
"It’s estimated that around 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women have some form of colour blindness."
- [Colour Accessibility](https://24ways.org/2012/colour-accessibility) (24ways.org / 2012)
"Colour blindness very rarely means that you can’t see any colour at all, or that people see things in greyscale. It’s actually a decreased ability to see colour, or a decreased ability to tell colours apart from one another."
