## Why another contrast tool ?

Just to **provide contrast solutions** !

There are lot of tools to find a good contrast on the web, but no one to suggest valid contrasts.

All tools just tell you whether the contrast is good or not, which is fine...
but insufficient. Webdesigners / webdevelopers need to easily have a good contrast.
That's the purpose of [Contrast-Finder.org](https://contrast-finder.org/)

**Contrast-Finder** is a tool which computes the contrast between two colors (background, foreground) and checks if the contrast is valid. When the contrast is not valid, the main target is to suggest some correct colors contrasts.
